[[USIS]] can first offer a write-back for better identification over time and across partners without modifying underlying datasets (waiting for partner commits)

[[OLTP]]: OLTP enables the real-time execution of large numbers of transactions by large numbers of people, whereas online analytical processing (OLAP) usually involves querying these transactions (also referred to as records) in a database for analytical purposes. OLAP helps companies extract insights from their transaction data so they can use it for making more informed decisions.

Build a high performance data clearinghouse with write-back OLTP across all servicers, allowing write/update transactions without requiring sync with API source.
