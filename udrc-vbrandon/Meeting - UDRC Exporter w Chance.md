# Discussion notes
- What feedback do you have from last exporter?
```

[[SQL]] format was confusing. Current exporter does not allow for standard SQL statements

[[naming]] of tablenames specified via supposedly aligned list - bad idea

[[web]] interface would be very helpful for him, other users

[[completion]] percentage not displayed - no way to display
