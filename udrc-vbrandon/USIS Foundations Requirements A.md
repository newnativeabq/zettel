Detail:  What elements need to be in place for USIS to be built?

---

### Questions/Cues
- System Uptime (~100%)
- Data Use Provisions (updated MOUs and MOU tracking system) with
- Data Mesh tied to Data Use Provisions to ensure we're using the right data for USIS and no leakage from adhoc gets in

### Notes
- Significant foundations work needed in base data system
	- Uptime unavailable (0 full uptime on system at new tenant as of 12.01)
	- MOU heterogeneity a big problem for standard implementations
	- Data mesh still very incomplete.  More design needed and alpha implementation tests (could be a 1yr project on its own)
