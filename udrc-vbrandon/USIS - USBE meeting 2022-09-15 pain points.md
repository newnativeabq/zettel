if you have data you want to share or an api you want to publish, sign up, select whether you agree to let the SLDS index your data for longitudinal study, and manage access from your personal dashboard or sync with management systems in house.

### Pain Points
MOUs are a pain. The lack of standard, lack of process standard, and lack of process transparency is slowing down everything.

Sharing data is hardest because:
1. MOU
2. Data interoperability not engineered in and compatability layers convoluted
3. Systems disaggregated in a bad way

## Main Idea
SLDS super system as master catalog/clearinghouse for data and data services.  One stop MOU, access management, and option serving/write-back infrastructure sign on.
