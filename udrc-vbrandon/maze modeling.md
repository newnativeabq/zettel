So I'm reading through the equity book for a spell, and of course my brain doesn't work. It thinks, what if life's a maze, could you draw courses and teachers and the distances be meaningful (https://sunjay.dev/2016/06/30/visualizing-maze-generation).  Curious, if you can draw the maze, then you can solve it for optimal paths (chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://cell-devs.sce.carleton.ca/publications/2003/LW03/SCSC03Maze.pdf).  And if the paths are designed correctly, it may be possible to define meaningful steps to go from some arbitrary path that someone is actually on to one that solves the maze.  If you could do that for everyone individually, would that be equitable?
