### Questions/Cues
- What makes this architecture useful? When?
- What needs to be understood about this architecture to minimally implement a mild production system?

### Notes
- The goal of the two tower approach is to take related document classes and embed them into the same vector space for nearest neighbor approximations.  The 'user-preference' query document is close to these 'candidate-item' documents.

### Summary
Highlight ==whatâ€™s important!==
```
An augmented two tower model, though potentially leading to improved results, is overkill for our little system (not enough sparsity to care?)
